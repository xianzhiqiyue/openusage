# Amp

## Overview

- **Protocol:** JSON-RPC (`POST /api/internal`)
- **URL:** `https://ampcode.com/api/internal`
- **Auth:** API key from Amp CLI (`~/.local/share/amp/secrets.json`)
- **Tier:** Free (daily replenishing quota) and/or individual credits

## Authentication

### Credential Source

The plugin reads the API key automatically from `~/.local/share/amp/secrets.json`, created by Amp CLI when you sign in. No manual setup required.

```json
{
  "apiKey@https://ampcode.com/": "sgamp_user_..."
}
```

The key is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` to the JSON-RPC API.

## Data Source

### API Endpoint

```
POST https://ampcode.com/api/internal
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
Content-Type: application/json

{"method": "userDisplayBalanceInfo", "params": {}}
```

### Response

The response contains a `displayText` string whose contents vary by user tier:

**Free tier + credits:**
```
Signed in as <user>
Amp Free: $<remaining>/$<total> remaining (replenishes +$<rate>/hour) [optional: +N% bonus for N more days] - https://ampcode.com/settings#amp-free
Individual credits: $<credits> remaining - https://ampcode.com/settings
```

**Paid credits only:**
```
Signed in as <user>
Individual credits: $<credits> remaining - https://ampcode.com/settings
```

The plugin parses the display text with regex to extract:
- **Balance:** `$remaining/$total remaining` → dollar amounts (only if Amp Free enabled)
- **Rate:** `replenishes +$rate/hour` → replenishment speed (only if Amp Free enabled)
- **Bonus:** `[+N% bonus for N more days]` → optional promotional bonus 
- **Credits:** `Individual credits: $N remaining` → paid credits balance

### Usage Calculation (Free tier only)

- **Used:** `total - remaining` (clamped to 0 minimum)
- **Reset time:** `used / hourlyRate` hours from now (null if nothing used or rate is zero)
- **Period:** 24 hours (fixed)
